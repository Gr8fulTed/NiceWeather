NiceWeather 
===========
### Premise
Never know what to say in those awkward situations? NiceWeather is the app for you. It provides crowdsourced excuses, euphemisms and pleasantries for any difficult social situations you might find yourself in. Add and share your own tips and vote and comment on those of others!

### Technology
NiceWeather is an iOS app targeting iOS 7+ on iPhones, iPads and iPods. The backend server will be written using Ruby and Sinatra. The frontend architecture is still under consideration, with Apache Cordova and native Swift being under consideration.
